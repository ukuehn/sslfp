Things that are still to do for sslanalyser:

- Test imap support more thoroughly

- Test with client certificates. This might already work with standard
  java mechanisms like -Djavax.ssl.keystore=..., but is completely untested
  yet.

- Implement a mode where Kerberos authentication is tested/supported.

- Have a mode where also the rejected ciphers are reported, so the user
  is able to tell how full the test was.

- Fix umlaut problem under windows. I18N here has property files
  encoded in utf-8 and uses native2ascii to convert non-ascii into
  respective character sequences. However, apparenty under Windows,
  at least the umlauts get garbled.
  So far, the german language file exists (probably out of sync with
  the english version), but is disabled.

- Try to determine port number from a service name.

- At least for HTTPS, try to retrieve some page on the server in order
  to distinguish if the server delivers a different service depending on
  the handshake protocol and ciphersuite.
